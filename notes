NOTE: If a chunk is unloaded, it is not saved. 


_ready() of chunk.gd is where the render loop starts basically.
1. Get data hash table 
2. generate the colliders in the main thread (_generate_chunk_collider)
    - call _create_block_collider on the position of every (solid block)
3. generate the mesh in a seperate thread (_generate_chunk_mesh)
    - Use SurfaceTool to generate OpenGL VBOs on each block position
    - Load this data into a MeshInstance
    - Call add_child on that MeshInstance (this adds a subnode)
    
    
This program has the property that the hit boxes of blocks need not correlate with their actual appearance. A chunk is a static body instance. Every visible block is associated to a subnode of the chunk static body, but the hitboxes are associated with the chunk itself.



Collision layer: what layers the object appears in
Collision mask : what layers the body will scan for collisions
