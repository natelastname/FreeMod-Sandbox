I am gratified by the amount of interest and participation that this event generated. We even got some new mappers to dip their toes in the Quake ocean. Thanks to everyone who entered; you guys are quite classy indeed. Also thanks to the judges, for giving their valuable time to lend their years of Quaking to this cause.
